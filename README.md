Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Coronavirus

Open in Colab to have better visualization

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update (2/4/2020)
Unfortunately, the data source has deprecated. 

However the model is performing well with the new data as well and the test score has increased due to an increase in the number of data points.
Train Score - 0.973499789968227
Test Score  - 0.9905344768309351

I will upload the final visualizations and the modified code once the pandemic dies down.
